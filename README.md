## Overview

This is a simple repo where I update my expertise and projects (also on GitHub) for my portfolio.

### Setup
To create your own copy of this, you can fork the repo and install the dependencies with
```
git clone https://github.com/finnholland/portfolio.git
```
```
cd portfolio 
```
```
npm i
```
and finally 
```
npm run dev
```

This will create the webpage on localhost:3000.
You will obviously have all of my details there and may want to update it to use yours unless you want to apply for jobs on my behalf :)

### Updating your details
I've tried to keep the project as simple as possible only requiring updates in a few files when you want to add some things in. Of course if you feel like changing it up a bit you can.
- These files are the json files inside `/app/info/*.json`
*You can find the types for these json objects inside `types.ts`*
- To add your own image, simply put your image in the repo as `/public/profile.jpg`
*you may have to delete the .next folder to see the change (it caches)*
- Change the LinkedIn and GitHub link in `/components/profile/profile.tsx` to your own.

That should be looking much more like your resum√©!

### Deploying
The way I did it was simply creating a project in AWS Amplify and linking it to my repo for CI/CD as it is a static web app.
However you can choose whichever hosting you want, even bare metal docker.

For Amplify you can see my repo [fromeroad](https://github.com/finnholland/fromeroad/blob/master/terraform/Instructions.md#amplify) (excluding env vars) in order to see how to host it on AWS.
