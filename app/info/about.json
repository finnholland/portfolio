  "bio": "Cloud Engineer who enjoys spending my spare time researching new technologies - trying my best to implement them, or hiking.",
  "shortBio": "I make things go up and down",
  "about": "My journey started with <a href='https://www.minecraft.net' target='_blank'>Minecraft</a> modding in 2012, the limitless world of creation in software quickly became one of my favourite things and I was hooked on tech ever since.\n\nComing back to now, I have had the pleasure of spending two years at a <a href='https://dxc.com' target='_blank'>multi-national firm</a> and a <a href='https://chamonix.com.au' target='_blank'>local start-up</a> learning new technologies and improving myself inside the industry while servicing large clients in industries such as employee management, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn my spare time I will often be found working on a new project trying to learn and implement something unknown to me onto the cloud.\n\nWhen I'm not spending time developing, I enjoy winding down with a hike or jog, cooking, or informational videos."
