  "about": "My journey started with <a href='https://www.minecraft.net' target='_blank'>Minecraft</a> modding in 2012, the limitless world of software quickly became one of my favourite things and I would only get more interested over the years.\n\nComing back to now, I have had the pleasure of interning at a <a href='https://dxc.com' target='_blank'>multi-national firm</a>, spending 2 years at a <a href='https://chamonix.com.au' target='_blank'>local start-up</a>, and beginning my journey into DevOps at an <a href='https://www.aligent.com.au/' target='_blank'>eCommerce specialist</a>, learning new technologies and improving myself inside the industry, while servicing large clients in industries such as employee management, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and online retail.\n\nIn my spare time I will often be found working on a new project trying to learn and implement something unknown to me or learning languages.\n\nWhen I'm not spending time developing, I enjoy winding down with a hike or jog, cooking, or music and movies."
